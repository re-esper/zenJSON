# ZenJSON
zenjson is a JSON parser/generator for C++.

zenjson is very high-performance. It is much faster than RapidJSON both in parsing/serializing, and only lose to simdjson a little in parsing normal jsons.

zenjson also has easy-to-use, intuitive syntax, benifits from modern C++.

zenjson is highly inspired from Richard Geldreich's [pjson](https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/810342151477493761), vivkin's [gason](https://github.com/vivkin/gason) and [RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson).

### Features
* No dependencies.
* Single header file. Simply drop zenjson.h into your project.
* Small code size (<2k loc) and memory-friendly (16-24bytes per value).
* In-stu parsing. That means it modifies and depends the input string.
